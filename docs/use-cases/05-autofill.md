# Predictive Cart Autofill

![Autofill Feature](../screenshots/features/autofill-cart.png)

*Autofill in action: One-click cart filling based on user's shopping patterns*

## Overview

The autofill feature demonstrates how Aito.ai can predict and automatically populate a shopping cart based on user behavior patterns. This time-saving feature learns from shopping history to suggest likely purchases, making routine shopping faster and more convenient.

## How It Works

### Traditional vs. Predictive Autofill

**Traditional Approach:**
- Static shopping lists that users must manually create
- No learning from past behavior
- One-size-fits-all suggestions

**Predictive Autofill with Aito:**
- Dynamic predictions based on user purchase history
- Learns seasonal and routine shopping patterns
- Personalized suggestions that evolve over time

### Implementation

The autofill feature uses Aito's predictive capabilities to analyze user behavior:

```javascript
// Core autofill logic from src/api/autofill.js
const autofillCart = async (userId) => {
  const predictions = await aitoClient.query({
    from: 'impressions',
    where: {
      'context.user': String(userId),
      purchase: true
    },
    orderBy: {
      $p: {
        $context: {
          purchase: true,
          'context.user': String(userId)
        }
      }
    },
    limit: 8
  })
  
  return predictions.map(item => item.product)
}
```

## Key Features

### 1. Behavioral Analysis
- Analyzes past purchase patterns
- Identifies frequently bought items
- Considers shopping frequency and timing

### 2. Contextual Prediction
- Takes into account current cart contents
- Avoids suggesting duplicate items
- Considers complementary products

### 3. Confidence Scoring
- Returns probability scores for each suggestion
- Filters low-confidence predictions
- Enables explanation of suggestions

## Data Schema

The autofill feature leverages purchase history data:

```json
{
  "impressions": {
    "session": "string",
    "product": "string",
    "purchase": "boolean",
    "timestamp": "datetime"
  },
  "products": {
    "id": "string",
    "name": "string",
    "category": "string",
    "price": "decimal"
  },
  "sessions": {
    "id": "string",
    "user": "string",
    "timestamp": "datetime"
  }
}
```

const AutofillButton = ({ userId, onItemsAdded }) => {
  const handleAutofill = async () => {
    try {
      const suggestions = await getAutofillSuggestions(userId)
      const confirmedItems = await showAutofillModal(suggestions)
      onItemsAdded(confirmedItems)
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Autofill failed:', error)
    }
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleAutofill}>
      Autofill Cart
    </button>
  )
}
```
