*Invoice processing in action: Automatic GL code assignment and approval routing*

## Overview

The invoice processing feature demonstrates how Aito.ai can transform manual document processing into an intelligent, automated workflow. By analyzing invoice content, the system automatically assigns GL codes, routes for appropriate approval, and extracts key fields with high accuracy.

## How It Works

### Traditional vs. AI-Powered Invoice Processing

**Traditional Processing:**
- Manual data entry and field extraction
- Static rules for GL code assignment
- Fixed approval workflows
- High error rates and processing delays

**AI-Powered Processing with Aito:**
- Automatic field extraction and classification
- Intelligent GL code prediction based on content
- Dynamic routing based on amount, vendor, and type
- Learning from historical processing decisions

### Implementation

The invoice processing uses multiple Aito prediction endpoints:

```javascript
// Core invoice processing logic
const processInvoice = async (invoiceData) => {
  // Predict GL code based on description and vendor
  const glPrediction = await aitoClient.predict({
    from: 'invoices',
    where: {
      description: invoiceData.description,
      vendor: invoiceData.vendor,
      amount: { $gte: invoiceData.amount * 0.8, $lte: invoiceData.amount * 1.2 }
    },
    predict: 'glCode'
  })

  // Predict appropriate processor
  const processorPrediction = await aitoClient.predict({
    from: 'invoices', 
    where: {
      glCode: glPrediction.value,
      amount: invoiceData.amount
    },
    predict: 'processor'
  })

  // Predict approval requirements
  const approvalPrediction = await aitoClient.predict({
    from: 'invoices',
    where: {
      amount: invoiceData.amount,
      glCode: glPrediction.value,
      vendor: invoiceData.vendor
    },
    predict: 'requiresApproval'
  })

  return {
    glCode: glPrediction.value,
    processor: processorPrediction.value,
    requiresApproval: approvalPrediction.value,
    confidence: {
      glCode: glPrediction.p,
      processor: processorPrediction.p,
      approval: approvalPrediction.p
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Features

### 1. Intelligent GL Code Assignment
- Analyzes invoice description and vendor
- Considers amount ranges for context
- Learns from historical coding decisions
- Provides confidence scores for predictions

### 2. Dynamic Approval Routing
- Routes based on amount thresholds
- Considers vendor relationships
- Adapts to organizational hierarchy
- Handles exception cases intelligently

### 3. Field Extraction
- Automatic vendor identification
- Amount and date extraction
- Description parsing and categorization
- Tax and line item recognition

## Data Schema

The invoice processing leverages multiple data tables:

```json
{
  "invoices": {
    "id": "string",
    "vendor": "string",
    "amount": "decimal",
    "description": "text",
    "glCode": "string",
    "processor": "string",
    "requiresApproval": "boolean",
    "processedDate": "datetime"
  },
  "glCodes": {
    "code": "string",
    "name": "string", 
    "category": "string",
    "department": "string"
  },
  "employees": {
    "id": "string",
    "name": "string",
    "department": "string",
    "approvalLimit": "decimal",
    "role": "string"
  }
}
```

## Processing Workflows

### Standard Invoice Flow

1. **Receipt & Extraction**
   - Invoice received via email/upload
   - OCR extraction of key fields
   - Initial data validation

2. **AI Classification**
   - GL code prediction based on content
   - Processor assignment based on expertise
   - Approval requirement determination

3. **Review & Approval**
   - Routed to predicted processor
   - Confidence scores guide review priority
   - Automated approval for high-confidence cases

4. **Exception Handling**
   - Low-confidence predictions flagged for review
   - Manual override capabilities
   - Learning from corrections

### Special Case Handling

**Large Amount Invoices:**
- Automatic escalation to senior approvers
- Additional verification requirements
- Multi-level approval workflows

**New Vendor Invoices:**
- Enhanced review processes
- Vendor verification steps
- Pattern learning for future invoices

**Recurring Invoices:**
- Streamlined processing for known patterns
- Automatic coding for utility bills
- Bulk processing capabilities

## Performance Benefits

- **Processing Speed**: Dramatically faster than manual processing
- **Accuracy**: High accuracy in GL code assignment
- **Automation Rate**: Majority of invoices processed without human intervention
- **Error Reduction**: Significant reduction in coding errors

## Implementation Example

```javascript
// Basic usage
import { processInvoice, validatePredictions } from '../api/invoiceProcessing'

const InvoiceProcessor = ({ invoiceData }) => {
  const [predictions, setPredictions] = useState(null)
  const [processing, setProcessing] = useState(false)

  const handleProcess = async () => {
    setProcessing(true)
    try {
      const results = await processInvoice(invoiceData)
      setPredictions(results)
      
      // Auto-approve if high confidence
      if (results.confidence.glCode > 0.9 && 
          results.confidence.processor > 0.8) {
        await autoApprove(results)
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Processing failed:', error)
    } finally {
      setProcessing(false)
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <InvoiceDetails data={invoiceData} />
      
      {predictions && (
        <PredictionResults 
          predictions={predictions}
          onApprove={handleApprove}
          onReject={handleReject}
        />
      )}
      
      <button onClick={handleProcess} disabled={processing}>
        {processing ? 'Processing...' : 'Process Invoice'}
      </button>
    </div>
  )
